The provided `main.cpp` source file is compatible with both the Arduino IDE and VSCode using PlatformIO. This script is tailored to operate on an STM32 Nucleo F4464RE Microcontroller. To replicate this setup, ensure that either the Arduino IDE or the PlatformIO IDE is properly configured.

For configuring the Arduino IDE, refer to: https://docs.simuli.co/getting-started/stm32/arduino-ide-and-virtual-lab/setting-up-arduino-ide-for-stm32

For the PlatformIO IDE, follow the steps outlined here: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#ide-vscode

If you are using PlatformIO, remember to include the `platformio.ini` configuration file to ensure correct settings and dependencies.

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to seamlessly run and experiment with the provided code on your STM32 Nucleo F4464RE Microcontroller.
